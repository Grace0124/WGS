    <i>Spring Fire</i>, published in 1952, was the first lesbian paperback novel. Although representation of the lesbian community is, in some ways, a step forward, the novel did not have a happy ending for its main couple. Susan and Leda, two women who meet at a college and have an affair, ends with Leda being placed in a mental institution.
