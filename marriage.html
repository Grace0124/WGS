    On February 12, 2004, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon are the first same-sex couple to be married, but the contract is voided by the California Supreme Court. In May of 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage,arguing that banning
    same-sex couples from marriage was unconstitutional. Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon are remarried one month later.
