    <h1>Welcome.</h1>
    <p>Think of your five favorite movies and TV shows. How many lesbian relationships do they have? What about gay male relationships? What about heterosexual relationships? How do you think this difference in representation throughout media and pop culture has impacted societal perceptions of lesbianism? </p>
    <p>How have societal views towards lesbianism changed in the past 50 years? How might this influence individual experiences?</p>
    <p>What challenges do lesbians face both at home and at work? </p>
    <p>Is being able to raise children a fundamental right all couples, regardless of gender or sexuality, deserve? How might stereotypes about what a family should look like affect two women hoping to have a child? How might it affect that child when they grow up?</p>
    <p>As you explore the exhibit, we invite you to think about these questions. Please keep in mind that each personâ€™s experience is different, and while our exhibit aims to show multiple journeys, it is unable to cover all of them. Our exhibit will investigate some of the main issues lesbians face: discrimination in the workplace, marriage and parenting rights, and lack of representation in media.</p>
