    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        Thank you for viewing our exhibit today. We hope that todayâ€™s exploration of the lesbian experience in regards to work, family, and media has helped you understand some of the nuances behind navigating life for queer women. While the past few years have seen improvements in LGBT rights, including anti-discrimination laws and legalized marriage, there still exists many stereotypes and implicit biases in American society.
